The inauguration of Terra Null Recordings marks a powerful coming together of forces from all over the globe, converging on this, a dark and ominous EP that foreshadows much of what is to come from the young label. American label founder Cirrus provides the EP’s title track ‘Shiver Shrapnel’, which hits hard and fast with an animalistic ferocity that is completely untamed. Meanwhile, from the other side of the world, established drum and bass beatsmith L 33 flips the ferocious title track on its head, delivering a brilliantly minimal experiment in pounding bass that feels suited only for the deepest and darkest caves that this planet has to offer. From the north, hailing from Quebec, the IDM prodigy Woulg establishes a presence on this EP that is immense. Descending upon the title track and sculpting it into something that seems to hardly belong on this earth. It simply must be listened to to be believed. Closing out the EP Cirrus returns the EP from outer space, landing it directly into the dense wilderness of ‘Tension and Confusion’, a track which aptly evokes these feelings as if the listener was suddenly lost in a harsh and unforgiving jungle. You are sure to come out on the other side of this EP dripping wet and hungry for more from Terra Null Recordings.
